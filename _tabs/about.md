I'm a `software engineer` by profession and `content creator`. I am currently working in `finance sector` for Loan Lending Platform(B2C) at Thoughtworks. Before this, I was working in `Health & Public Sector` for Document Verification Platform(B2B). The contents and opinions on this blog are my own. I have **_primarily worked on building scalable distributed system_** using NodeJs, Typescript, Java, Kotlin, MicroServices, REST APIs, SQL and NoSQL Databases.

My current _technical focus is on distributed system, including MicroServices and CI/CD_. I also have working experience in Jenkins and Kubernetes for CI/CD.
