I had a use case where I wanted to `update the implementation` of the algorithm based on the trigger `without restarting the app`. This app is written using java(spring) and it exposes API to be consumed. Here, **whenever the configuration is changed in the repository, the app is notified to reload the code**. `Java allows us to use our implementation of the class loader` and using this, I implemented the required functionality.
